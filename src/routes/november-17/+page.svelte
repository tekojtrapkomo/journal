                1. branding: the art of meaning
            </div>
            <p>alright let‚Äôs talk about brand. i found out that everyone‚Äôs perception of brand is so different. but i‚Äôve always wondered about it, the ideology behind it.

                let‚Äôs start with the etymology. it‚Äôs actually a german word called brandt which means fire or burn. so what does that have to do with companies and branding tho? where i‚Äôm from, Mongolia, we stamp horses (such beautiful and mystique creatures) and other livestock to recognize and differentiate them from our neighbors livestock. in old Germany or England, they used burn stamps to mark books, barrels of goods, and even tools to show ownership or craftsmanship.
                
                <br> <br>so, branding is basically marking or labeling, right? at least on the surface. but if we look at it from a psychological standpoint, it‚Äôs the gut feeling you get when you see that label or mark. therefore, branding becomes an art form, it‚Äôs all about evoking emotions. just like music, film, or poetry, if it makes you feel something, it‚Äôs art! (citing GOAT Paula Scher here)
                
               <br> i mean i'm no expert on branding (as of now), but, idea -> concept -> mission vision value -> execution (logo, ads and what else). <br> <br>does anyone remember that Ms.Lauryn Hill once said "how you gonna win if you ain't right within?"
                
                oh and also a huge shoutout to all the unmeaningful things out there. without them, the meaningful and true things wouldn‚Äôt shine as brightly. </p>

                2. house/hip hop music
            </div>
<p>to me, music is all about the emotion it evokes. i love the idea of clubs‚Äîlet the subwoofer and high frequencies flow through your body and mind. dance until you can‚Äôt anymore, until your legs give out, or cry to music with shades on. it‚Äôs raw. it‚Äôs personal.
    <br> <br> 
    how many of you have gone to a club and had an emotional breakdown? it‚Äôs weird, yeah, but it‚Äôs so idk how to say but different? it‚Äôs truly an experience for people who truly love music. you feel me? at the same time, i hate the club scene. people needing alcohol just to feel the music, or some hookup culture i mean i don't dig that, that‚Äôs not who i am. my ideal clubbing is about being with likeminded people, all of us just excited to experience the music, loud and safe. that idea solidified for me after seeing Andre 3000 put hundreds of us in a trance. _shout out to my boy Noah!
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    if clubs were places where people could be exactly who they are, i swear y'all would love dance music sooo much more. but here‚Äôs the twist: dance music isn‚Äôt about dancing. and electronic music isn‚Äôt always dance music either. i had this realization out of nowhere a night in july 2021. i thought: dance music isn‚Äôt actually about the dancing but it‚Äôs about the feeling. it‚Äôs about groove, bounce, rhythm, emotion. maybe i‚Äôm biased because i grew up around it, but it‚Äôs so much nice, i might write a full entry just about music later next month, and jazz and blues too!
    <br>
    house music and hip hop? they‚Äôre the same. same roots, different sounds. one came from the urge for freedom, the other from the repression of self-expression. 
    <br>
    next year, i might be in an all kenzo blazer and shit, but i‚Äôll still be hip hop and house than u can imagine. </p>
<br>
    i've always wanted to release an full length, cohesive and concept album, now i got the concept and we make it real next year.

rough draft of the first song off the album maybe? (it may or may not make it to album). creds to Engun for guide for vocals and crazy ass bass. lmao my recording of breathing in the first part made perfect sense.

i feel like i been talking too much since 2014,¬† let's get into the work now y'all feel me? i remember Adam told us that on the first day of art direction class "The vision without execution is illusion".

                3. art I: typefaces
            </div>
            <p>
                honestly, i‚Äôm no expert at anything. i can code and build a web app, design stuff, make a song or two, animate, even write creative copy (lil bit). but am i a master of any of these? no. for a while, i thought i was just going to be a jack of all trades and master of none. and yeah, it‚Äôs valuable to know a little about everything, but i want to be an master/expert at something i love. and i can say now, that is a TYPE for me.

type is everywhere, but no one notices it until it‚Äôs wrong right? it‚Äôs the root of communication. every curve, every pixel, every bit of spacing can make you feel something. it's a very powerful art form, just by the shapes you can evoke emotions, and with the words.. man that's art. 

after digging deep into typefaces, i remember learning to read by looking at street signs that's in 3,4th microdistrict in ulaanbaatar (11000 to my city). i don‚Äôt remember the exact sign, but it was probably something like ‚Äúbarber‚Äù or ‚Äúpawn shop,‚Äù white on red. 

even the fonts people hate, like comic sans or papyrus, have their place. they get hate because they‚Äôre used in the wrong context, but when they‚Äôre used right, they do just perfect. waittt that was so beautiful. 
<br>
ok now i'm thinking about creating my own typeface, maybe next summer. something timeless with heart and soul.

            </div>
            <p>have you ever closed your eyes to feel the music more? i get vivid visuals when i do. sometimes i think maybe i should be a music video director. but nah, that feels too small. my gut tells me i‚Äôm destined for something bigger.

                i love coding. i love the logic of it. i love layout design. maybe i‚Äôm meant to be the person who oversees the creative side of things but also dabbles in the business (root) side. maybe i‚Äôm meant to be an entrepreneur. my gut tells me i‚Äôm on the right path, art director, creative director, entrepreneur (fuck i hate this word).
                <br>
                it‚Äôs not about the titles, though. it‚Äôs about the vision and the steps i‚Äôm taking to make it real. <br>
                
             time to make my visions into a real life by doing it now. <br>i‚Äôve realized that in the future, my private life will go not too public, but my work will be loud. not just loud, it‚Äôll demand to be experienced. it'll scream right into your face, but you'll have a choice tho lmao. and me? i‚Äôll be cozy at home, smiling, home cooking, smiling and stuff. &<br>AM______FM logo december 20!! </p>

            </div>
            <p> still meditating, still thinking about life, every night concluding different stuff. how it‚Äôs this strange mix of beauty and weight, how it‚Äôs both a gift and a real misery. but i get it. it‚Äôs life, it's just life. it‚Äôs messy, but it‚Äôs okay.

                lately, i‚Äôve been closing my eyes and letting it all hit me. the feelings, the thoughts, the pull. it‚Äôs like standing in the middle of a storm, knowing you can‚Äôt control it, but also knowing i can handle it. i just let it pass through me you know, let it do its thing, and i keep standing.
                <br><br>
                i‚Äôve had sooooo much in life. still have soooo much. honestly, i‚Äôve had everything i thought i wanted. but there‚Äôs always been this feeling, this fucking shadow of dissatisfaction and unhappiness like nothing was ever enough. i once again found my old ask.fm yesterday. reading it felt like looking at a version of me who was searching so hard for something. it‚Äôs wild to think how far i‚Äôve come and how some of those questions still echo today bro. <br> <br>
                <img src={img6} alt="">
                <img src={img7} alt="">
                see that? why was i like this? why did i carry so much weight back then? and if i was really like this back then, i was going backwards since then. but maybe it all started on 2011 december 20 i really feel like. 
                what i‚Äôve realized is, my unhappiness is about me being ungrateful ass brat. it came from my expectations. wanting life to happen on my terms, at my speed. but ofc that‚Äôs not how it works. life doesn‚Äôt actually owe you a map. but ofc i can handle it.
                <p style="font-size: 2rem">who am i to fix other's problem when i haven't even fixed mine? but good news is, but i just might have the answer now üòÆ‚Äçüí®</p>
                <p>since all is empty then all is possible right? it's so obvious that this life has no meaning deep down (for humans), so in order to live, is finding the meaningness in this life right. <br>
                     music is nice, art is beautiful, designing and creating feels so good. but to me it's always has been to love and to be loved. that's the ultimate goal. and i was so bad and sucked at it. got me even thinking last week i don't deserve to be loved, but wtf. all this pain, guilt, shame, regret, self-doubt, pressure, insecurity actually will lead to me becoming a better "lover", a better human being, eventually. but the thought of becoming better for what? arises everytime. for who? for me? yes, i'm most grateful for that. but there's someone who really deserves this love i'm that building and a wholesome person that i'm becoming. why? because maybe there's person that we can't stop caring about for life, you know.</p>
